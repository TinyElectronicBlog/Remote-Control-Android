# Remote-Control-Android
An Android application to manage devices remotely over the Internet, including ESP32s using the library https://github.com/TinyElectronicBlog/TEB_Library.

The source code was written trying to simplify the use of Java classes, at the expense of efficiency. Not all methods include error checking and perhaps not all exceptions are managed.
